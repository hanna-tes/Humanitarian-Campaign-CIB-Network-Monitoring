# Humanitarian Campaign Monitor

This project provides a Streamlit dashboard to monitor the viral social media campaign urging users to "leave a dot" in response to posts about humanitarian issues. It's designed to analyze the campaign's performance, detect signs of coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB), and identify associated fundraising campaigns.

## Features

- **Campaign Pulse:** Tracks the volume and spread of key phrases like "leave a dot" over time.
- **CIB Network Analysis:** Visualizes networks of accounts sharing similar content to identify potential coordination.
- **Fundraising & Risk:** Automatically detects fundraising links in the posts and assesses them for risk based on the CIB analysis.
